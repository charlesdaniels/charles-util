.SH NAME
swizzle - modify sub-group orderings of records

.SH SYNOPSIS
swizzle [\-h] [\-\-rs RS] [\-\-input INPUT] \fB\-\-spec\fR SPEC [\-\-output
OUTPUT] [\-\-onempty ONEMPTY] [\-\-no_strip] [\-\-version]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP

A tool for re\-ordering input records in an intuitive way. Input records are
ordered into groups of the same size as the spec (a spec of size 3 would mean
groups of 3). Each such group is re\-ordered according to the spec. The spec is
a comma delimited list of integers which act as subscripts into the group,
such that an input of 'a b c d' with a spec of '1,1,2,2' would produce as
output 'b b c c', and the same input with a spec of '3,2,1,0' would produce 'd
c b a'. This program was inspired by the 'swizzle' operation in the game
EXAPUNKS. If the number of records of input is not a multiple of group size,
then any references to non\-existent indices in the spec are simply ignored.

.SH HISTORY

swizzle was originally written in early September of 2018 after the author
spent an inordinate amount of time trying to find an elegant solution to
re-order individual PDF pages such that every sub-group of 4 pages had the
third and fourth page swapped. As a suitable shell-friendly solution could
not be found, swizzle was born.

.SH CHANGELOG

.IP 0.0.1
Initial version.

.IP 0.0.2
