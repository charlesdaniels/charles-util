This repository is where I drop scripts, utilities, and tools which are too
small to warrant their own repositories. This was formerly integrated into my
dotfiles repository, but by popular demand I have made it a standalone
reppository.

Level of documentation or robustness of these scripts may vary. Some of them
may be bitrotted. Use at your own risk.
