# `charles-util`

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/charles-util/badge/?version=latest)](https://charles-util.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

# Overview

This repository is where I drop scripts, utilities, and tools which are too
small to warrant their own repositories. This was formerly integrated into my
dotfiles repository, but by popular demand I have made it a standalone
reppository.

Level of documentation or robustness of these scripts may vary. Some of them
may be bitrotted. Use at your own risk.

# Installation

Scripts can be installed using `make install`. This will install the scripts
into `~/bin`. You can perform a system-wide install by setting a prefix, for
example `make PREFIX=/usr/local install`, which would install the scripts into
`/usr/local/bin`.
