# charles-util

This is a collection of tools and utilities I have written which are large
enough to warrant packaging properly and writing man pages for, but not large
enough to make a dedicated project/repository/package worthwhile.

A reasonable effort is made to polish, test, and document these tools, but some
edge cases may not be handled gracefully, and portability to arbitrary
platforms is not guaranteed, although release are compiled as static executable
as much as possible to improve portability.

Note that the charles-util release number does not used semantic versioning -
this is because each tool is versioned individually (a changelog is recorded in
each tool's manpage). A charles-util release is simply a collection of the
constant tools at specific versions.

## Future Plans

* Testing methodology for individual tools where possible.
* TravisCI setup
* TravisCI Release Uploading
* Better man pages for pdfutil
* Refactoring for pdfutil

## Installation

See [INSTALL](./INSTALL).
