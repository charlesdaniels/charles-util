Documentation for ``get-docs``

.. contents::



This script attempts to find documentation and/or help for a particular
command automatically. Supported documentation formats include, in order of
precedence:

* shelldoc
* toolchest-style documentation (no longer used for new scripts, this type of
  documentation was specific to my "Toolchest" project, and some of my
  scripts that haven't needed re-writing still use it)
* man pages
* command-line help flags
