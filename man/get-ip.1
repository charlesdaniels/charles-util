.TH GET-IP "1" "October 2018" "get-ip 0.0.1" "User Commands"

.SH NAME
get-ip - get LAN or WAN IP

.SH SYNOPSIS
get\-ip [\-h] [\-\-version] [\-\-wan] [\-\-int]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Get the IP address of the primary NIC on the system. This works by opening a
socket connection and immediately closing it, then inspecting the local side
of the socket to see which IP address is the origin of the connection. This
makes a nice way to determine what IP the running machine can be reached at
even when multiple NICs are present, or a given NIC has several IP addresses.
Note that this script is guaranteed to return an IP that the system it is run
at is resolvable at, but not necessarily the *only* such IP. As a convenience
feature, this script also supports retrieving the current system's WAN IP
using ident.me and/or icanhazip.com.
