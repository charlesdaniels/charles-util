To install, simply run

make BIN_INSTALL_DIR=<somewhere> MAN_INSTALL_DIR=<somewhere> install

If you are installing from a release, the appropriate build artifacts will
already be present in ./bin and ./man. If you are installing from source, the
build artifacts will be generated as needed.

Known dependencies to install from source:

* python3.X with pip and virtualenv
* upx (optional but recommended)
* groff
* bookman
* pandoc
* taglib development files (libtag1-dev on Debian, taglib-devel on Fedora)
